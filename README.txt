1. We tuned the heuristic a little bit (weighting on different moves) and now can consistently beat ConstantTimePlayer.

2. We both pair-programmed to initially beat simple player using just a simple heuristic, then beat constant time player by utilizing the same heuristic but by building a depth 2 decision tree, and then beat constant time player consistently by just tuning the heuristic a little bit.

3. We tried a variety of different weighting strategies until the best performance was observed against ConstantTimePlayer. This accomplished our goal of beating ConstantTimePlayer relatively consistently, so this was our improvement for the tournament.
